"""Environment-resolved configuration for the UI server.

Required env (no silent default for a required value, code-quality rule 4 — a
missing one raises ``DisError``; this service deliberately defines no new
config-error class because the Slice-13a dis-core edit is pinned to exactly the
three auth-seam errors; the streaming-consumer precedent applies):

- ``POSTGRES_URL`` — the DIS connection (``ithina_dis_user``). Reused by
  ``dis-rls`` ``create_rls_engine``, which positively asserts
  ``current_database()=='ithina_dis_db'`` and a NOSUPERUSER/NOBYPASSRLS role
  (DIS on 5433, never Customer Master).
- ``GCS_BUCKET_BRONZE`` — the bronze bucket the CSV upload writes to (Slice 8;
  the same env name the csv-ingest-worker cross-checks the published
  ``gcs_uri`` against, so producer and consumer cannot drift).
- ``PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID`` — the Pub/Sub project for the ``csv.received`` publish.

OPTIONAL env (NOT in the required-or-crashloop set):

- ``GEMINI_VERTEX_PROJECT`` / ``GEMINI_VERTEX_LOCATION``: the Vertex AI project and
  location for the mapping-suggestion endpoint. Auth is GCP-native (Application
  Default Credentials from the Cloud Run service account), NOT an API key. BOTH
  UNSET is a normal state: the suggester falls back to the mechanical matcher, so
  missing config must NEVER abort startup (they are read with no raise).
- ``GEMINI_IMPERSONATE_SA``: optional service-account email (gemini-dis) to
  IMPERSONATE for the Vertex calls only. When set (with project+location), the
  suggester impersonates this SA via short-lived credentials; the service still
  runs as its own SA for everything else. Unset -> the ambient ADC (the Cloud Run
  service account) is used directly. Read with no raise.

Resolution happens inside the app lifespan, NOT at import time: a missing
required value aborts startup loudly (crashloop is the correct signal for
misconfiguration), while a present-but-unreachable database must NOT block
startup — the engine is lazy and the first connect happens in ``/readyz``,
which degrades to 503. That split is the liveness/readiness foundation this
slice is built on and is test-pinned.

The dev-stub verifier parameters are NOT config: they are contract-pinned
constants in ``auth/verifier.py`` (byte-identical to the UI's ``/dev/login``
stub so dev tokens round-trip; env-overridable values would invite drift).
