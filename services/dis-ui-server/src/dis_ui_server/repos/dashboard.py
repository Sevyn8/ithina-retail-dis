"""Dashboard metric reads - pure tenant-scoped SELECTs over existing tables.

Every statement runs inside ONE ``rls_session(engine, tenant_id)`` so the per-tenant
GUC (``app.tenant_id``) scopes the audit / quarantine / canonical reads exactly like
the other tenant-facing read repos (mapping-templates, stores). Read-only: no writes,
no DDL, no business logic beyond aggregation. Canonical reads go through the dis-rls
helper (hard rule 1).

Sources:
- ``audit.events`` RECEIVED/SUCCESS rows carry the upload's ``row_count`` (the CSV
  upload receiver emits one per accepted upload) and ``event_data->>'template_id'``.
- ``quarantine.quarantined_rows`` / ``quarantined_chunks`` carry ``quarantined_at``.
- ``canonical.*`` are the mapping-produced ingest tables (signal_history is derived
  daily-compute output, NOT ingested records, so it is excluded from the count).
